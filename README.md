# Asychronous_JS
This assignment focuses on implementing asynchronous programming concepts in JavaScript. It aims to demonstrate the use of asynchronous operations such as Promises, async/await, and callbacks to manage tasks that take time to complete without blocking the execution of code.

# Features

1. **Fetching Data:** Implementing functions to fetch data from APIs using asynchronous requests.
2. **Error Handling:** Demonstrating effective error handling strategies in asynchronous code.
3. **Chaining Promises:** Showing how to chain multiple Promises for sequential execution of asynchronous tasks.
4. **User Interaction:** Building a simple user interface to interact with asynchronous operations, providing real-time feedback.

# Technologies Used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
